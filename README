A simple game counter.

When you start a game, it will prompt you for the number of counters and the
initial value of each counter.

Click on the player labels to change them.

To use the counters:
- Spacebar advances to the next counter.
- Up and Down increment and decrement the current counter.

If you forget the keyboard shortcuts, you can press ?.

Enjoy!
